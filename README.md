# Path planning Algorithms

## Algorithms

Currently two different path planning algorithms are covered

1. Random Approach
2. Optimal Approach

### Random Approach

Robot randomly finds a path and get to the goal point from the origin

### Optimal Approach

Currently the following algorithms were implemented

1. A-Star algorithm

#### A-Star Algorithm

Robots estimates the shortest optimal path from the origin using A-Star approach and reaches the goal point
